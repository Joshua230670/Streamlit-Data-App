# Streamlit Data App

The purpose of this application is to provide the user all the information about the catalog from the game 'Animal Crossing New Horizon' developed by Nintendo.

The user can:
* Select the .csv file of their choice containing the category of catalog.
* View all the information of the entries.
* Filter what information they would like to see.
* View the information in the form of a bar graph.
* Determine the x-axis and y-axis of the bar graph to display the desired information.

### Dataset
The datasset used to create this project was sourced from Kaggle, a site comprised of users who upload datasets for public use. The user '[jessicali9530](https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530)' along with
several other contributors listed in the dataset's page created the CSV files.

The page to the dataset can be found [here.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nookplaza-dataset)

### Instructions
To begin using the application, the user must choose from the selection box what CSV file they would like to view. Once chosen, the table will display all the information

By selecting the bar chart on the tab, the user will be prompted to select two values to determine the chart's x-axis and y-axis.
After the selection, the chart will update with the desired information.
